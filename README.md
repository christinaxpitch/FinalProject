### Overview
 CragTalk seeks to ease the process of finding a climbing partner. Whether it's having someone spot you with a crash pad while bouldering or belaying you while you lead climb, CragTalk is a web app that allows users to connect with other climbers based on location, favorite climbing areas, skill level, and the type of gear that they have.

### Description
The world of climbing can be very tight knit and yet welcoming to new comers. Climbers love talking, climbing, hanging out and sharing experiences with others interested in the sport. CragTalk harnesses this aspect of the sport to create a social web application allowing users to message one another, favorite climbers, create climbing events, and connect with others who share their passion.

#### Users
Users are able to browse the profile of other climbers and obtain basic climbing information about the climber, favorite climbing areas, has the climber been a lead climber, does the climber have a dog, and the climbers favorite beverage. With this information the user will be able to decide whether to make a connection with the climber. The connection can be established by utilizing CragTalk's in-app messaging feature.

Other than viewing the profile of other climbers, a user may browse information regarding local climbing locations as well as group events. Within the details of a climbing location a user can view a list of climbers who have added the location to their favorites list as well as which events have been held at the location. This way a user can connect with others who may climb similar locations.

### Lessons Learned
Massaging mappings, JSON properities, to present an appropriate amount of information and preventing recursion as the greatest lesson learned by the team.

Pair programming was essential to completing the process. Not a single one of us would have been able to complete the sprint without help from our other teammates. We leaned on each other and instructors to help us through problems that we were encountering and we were able to overcome all of them to date. Unfortunately, we spent some valuable time debugging that left us with some functionality left to future versions.

We also learned more about console errors and debugging in general. Not being afraid of new errors and quickly recognizing duplicate errors for quick resolution.

We utilized Basic Authentication for the first time extensively and learning about how to set, recall and reset the session data for use as a user navigates the site.
